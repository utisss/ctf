  Welcome! Today is your first day as a summer intern at E-Corp (aka Evil Corp aka E-Crime Corp). Your summer project will consist of expanding E-Corp's access to computer networks. Inspired by the Mirai botnet, E-Corp has spun up a new division dedicated to gaining access into IOT devices. Your summer project will be to find and exploit a vulnerability in a modern router. A fellow intern has already found a stack pointer leak, so you know that a stack pointer on the server is 0x7c974a30. Good luck!

  The hosted website is an emulated version of a real router bought on Amazon. The emulated firmware was dumped directly off a real device. If your exploit is written well, it will work on real routers in the wild. Please use your exploit responsibly - ISSS claims no responsiblity for your behavior. *If you find a zero day, please disclose it appropriately to the relevant manufacturer(s).* A script will automatically restart the router if it has crashed. If you can't access it after 10 minutes, please message an officer.

  The firmware can be found [here](https://utexas.box.com/s/lvs6vf1ahiw29cm1rhs4swevjz04ny7q).

  * Note that due to networking constraints, you will need to connect over a bind shell. Ports 1336-1440 inclusive will be forwarded to the router.
