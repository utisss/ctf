# Forbidden Fruit

The main page says "only humans are allowed" and "please don't go looking at pages you shouldn't", which hints about looking at non-humans (i.e. web crawlers) and pages that are disallowed.

The robots.txt file lists files that web crawlers shouldn't crawl. That file has a link to an HTML page with the flag.
