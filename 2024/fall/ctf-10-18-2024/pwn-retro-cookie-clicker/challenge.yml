hints:
  - Have you ever used a program like Cheat Engine? What exactly does it do?
  - Many console emulators have debug/cheat features that allow you to view and modify game memory.
  - The game engine I made this in only supports 16-bit signed integers for some reason. I had to
  account for this when programming the game.
