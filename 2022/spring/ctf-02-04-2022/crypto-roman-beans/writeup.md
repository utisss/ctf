## Write Up

- This can be recognized as a simple substitution cipher because symbols like '{', '}', and '_' are left unchanged.
- The name and prompt both hint that this is a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).
- Whenever you encounter a substitution cipher, you should always try a caesar cipher [decoder](https://manansingh.github.io/Cryptolab-Offline/c2-brute-caesar.html) because you can brute force it in 26 tries.
