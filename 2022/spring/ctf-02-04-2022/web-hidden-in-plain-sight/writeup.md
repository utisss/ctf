 ## Potential Solves

 #### Method 1
Opening up developer tools is always a good first step. In this case, you may see that the html includes a header tag with the flag in it.

 #### Method 2
If you explore the page a bit, you may notice your mouse changes to a bar the way it usually does when you hover over text. If you try to highlight the area, you'll see the hidden text.

 #### Method 3
 Ctrl + F and search for `utflag{`
