# Web: Extra Fancy Beans
This problem points you to a simple webpage without any real functionality. 
However, if you look at the provided URL, you can see there are some other 
directories included in the website. The hint is supposed to prompt you to 
try looking in these other directories above the "can-of-beans" directory. 
Luckily, the website has directory listings on, which allows you to explore 
all the available files on it. If you do this, you can navigate to the top-
level directory, and see a "secret-recipe" directory, which contains the 
flag.
