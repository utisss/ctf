hints:
  - Write out the encrypt function on paper and expand. What operation is being performed here?
  - Given a polynomial of order n, how many points are needed to determine the polynomial? Remember you're working in a prime order field. 
  - Suppose you're given two points on a line. How would you determine the equation of the line? What about a parabola given three points? What about a cubic equation given four points?
