  Try to get one of the officers to say any of the words on this forbidden wordlist. If you do, they'll give you the flag.

  If you're in person, you can likely find an officer at the front of the atrium or walking around between teams. If you're online, hop onto the voice channel and ping an @Officer that you want to talk :)
