This problem's title is sus as hell. It's telling you to inspect the cookies for the linked site in
your browser. If you do this, you'll find a `flag` cookie with the flag as the value. You can check
your cookies in most browsers by opening the "Developer Tools" (these might have to be manually
enabled on Safari), and then looking for a tab that says "Application/Storage" or "Cookies".
