# Frightening Front-End Experience
This problem points you to a webapp that asks you to enter your age before entering. However, the
webapp has a bug where the age field has a maximum value of 17. This restriction is implemented in
the webpage's form field using the `max` parameter for the `input` element. If you right-click and
"Inspect Element", you can simply modify this parameter, and enter an age above 18 to get the flag.
