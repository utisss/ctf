# Spooky Scary Skeletons
This problem gives you a "corrupted" audio file, and asks you to investigate it. The hint is
supposed to imply looking at the file's frequency spectrum, which you can do in most audio editing
programs, such as Audacity. In Audacity, you can do this by clicking on the drop-down arrow by the
track title, and selecting "Spectrogram". To look at the full spectrum, you'll also need to change
the spectrogram settings in the same menu to start at 0 Hz. Once you do this, you'll see that a
section of the song (around 15 seconds in) has some characters written in the spectrogram.
