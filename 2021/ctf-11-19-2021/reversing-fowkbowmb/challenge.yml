description: "My fwiend sent me this binarwy and told me it would eventually pwint out the flag. Unfortunately, it does something else too...
  Note: this binary is an actual forkbomb! I've neutered it (it sets its own process limit to 1023) so you shouldn't be able to crash your own system, but be careful!
