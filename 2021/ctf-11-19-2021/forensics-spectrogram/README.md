# Forensics: Spectro
This challenge incolves a .wav audio file, which sounds like a bunch of random
tones. The prompt hints that you want to look at the frequencies making up the
audio, so we can use a Spectrogram viewer, such as the online one below:

Essentially, a spectrogram viewer breaks down a piece of audio to the 
frequencies that make up the sound. In this case, plotting the frequencies on a
graph like the one above shows the flag.
