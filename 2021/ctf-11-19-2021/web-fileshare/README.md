# In a Pickle
Monopoly Man is in a pickle and he needs your help! He's in jail and he can't afford bail. All he has is a bunch of ones. The only way out is to commit wire fraud. Fortunately, he happens to know that the banker stored his password on a crappy web app made by some random guy named Daniel. http://ctf.isss.io:8651
