Da Rulez

My grandkids refuse to play Monopoly with me! They're too busy on their dang phones what with the fortnites and the Mindcrafts. They told me Monopoly is a game for old people and encrypted my copy of the rules so I can't teach them how to play. Luckily they used a very old cipher, one that was cracked 41 years before Monopoly was even invented. I'm sure you can help me teach those whippersnappers how to play a proper game.
