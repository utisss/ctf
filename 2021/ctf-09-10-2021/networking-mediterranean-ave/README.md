# Networking: Mediterranean Ave
In this challenge, a pcap file is given, which contains a login over HTTP 
to the site `ctf.isss.io:4375/login`. The login can be used at the same site to 
login and see the flag.

## Prompt
I was sniffing my friend's internet traffic while we were playing Monopoly but most 
of his traffic was encrypted. Can you help me get some intel on his strategy?

## Hint
Looks like the flag was redacted. Try to see if there's a way to access it again.

## Flag
`utflag{m3d1t3rran3an_av3_0p}`
