description: I just uncovered some ancient conversations between Alice and Bob, when they were kids. Some of the text got lost, but it should be fine right?

I think they were trying to learn RSA, but real RSA was too hard for them. Since they were kids, I think they were using something called baby RSA? Or wait, no... I forgot.
