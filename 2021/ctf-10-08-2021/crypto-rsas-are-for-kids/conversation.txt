Bob: RSA is too hard, can we learn something easier

Alice: yeah we can try ___ RSA, apparently its for learning RSA idk

Bob: ok

Bob: how does this work tho

Alice: uh lemme generate the keys first

Alice: ok try using this as the public key ___________________________

Bob: aight

Bob: so if i encrypt 69, i should get 72970812?


Alice: yeah 

Alice: and if u encrypt 420, then u should get 42262748.

Bob: this hurts my brain :(

Bob: i think i get it tho. can u try to decrypt this for me

Bob: 2365203

Alice: o is that your flag
