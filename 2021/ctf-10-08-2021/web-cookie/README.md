# Web: Flag Folks
In this problem the website serves an challenge to factor a very large number, which is practically
impossibly to complete during the CTF, without access to a supercomputer.

The hint is supposed to inspire checking the site's cookies in your browser (which you can lookup
how to do with a quick Google), which reveals a cookie `isFlagFolk` that is set to false. Modifying 
the cookie to be `true` bypasses the challenge and reveals the flag.
